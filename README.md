# Black Forest Demo Sensor Code

This repository contains various code and scripts to help test and debug our forest network and [store-forward API](https://github.com/saycel/black-rock-forest-store-and-forward). As the directory name suggests, code found in the [Skeleton](https://github.com/saycel/Black-Rock-Forest-Demo-Sensor-Code/tree/master/Skeleton) folder is barebones, requiring further additions to have it send data that's more significant than just random or incremented numbers. Code found in the [Example](https://github.com/saycel/Black-Rock-Forest-Demo-Sensor-Code/tree/master/Example)  folder however makes use of the skeleton code to show how it can be used effectively. However, all programs here should work "as-is" if the intent is just to test them and/or our existing solutions.

## Prerequisites
Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to use the code in this repository.

You'll also want to have a [WeMos D1 R1](https://ns-electric.com/product/wemos-d1-r1-arduino-compatible-esp8266/) or other [ESP8266-Compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) device to put the demo code onto.

Lastly, you'll want a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) running the latest version of [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md). It'll also need to have our [store and forward node API](https://github.com/saycel/black-rock-forest-store-and-forward) running on it!

## Getting Started
All folders contain code that's ready to be run, save for a couple of light modifications. Further documentation can be found within said folders.
