## SensorEmulatorSkeleton.py

### About

SensorEmulatorSkeleton.py is a python file written by Jeremy that connects to a network and pushes random data to the Raspberry Pi. However, it has a one-line edit by me to get it working with the HTTP API that the Raspberry Pi has.

### Prerequisites

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.0

### Running

Run the file from a terminal after making the necessary changes to it.
